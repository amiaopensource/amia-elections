# Governance Recommendations

The scope of this repository is for AMIA members to collaborate specifically upon a review of the AMIA Elections Manual. In many areas the mandates and constraints defined in the Election Manual relate to sections of other governing documents of AMIA. Thus this document is established to collect proposals for review or changes to governing documents of AMIA outside of the Elections Manual with the hope that the AMIA Board and Governance Commmittee takes these into consideration.
