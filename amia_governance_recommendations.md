# Governance Recommendations

The scope of this repository is for AMIA members to collaborate specifically upon a review of the AMIA Elections Manual. In many areas the mandates and constraints defined in the Election Manual relate to sections of other governing documents of AMIA. Thus this document is established to collect proposals for review or changes to governing documents of AMIA outside of the Elections Manual with the hope that the AMIA Board and Governance Commmittee takes these into consideration.

## Bylaws. EC Member Count

The Elections Manual states:

> The Committee should consist of three (3) or more Individual Members of AMIA. An odd number of members is recommended.

and the Bylaws state in Article VI §2(b)(i)

> The Elections Committee shall consist of two (2) or more members.

It is recommended that the mandate language of both is changes to `shall` and that both reference a minimum of 3 members.
