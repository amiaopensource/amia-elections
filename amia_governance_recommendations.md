# Governance Recommendations

The scope of this repository is for AMIA members to collaborate specifically upon a review of the AMIA Elections Manual. In many areas the mandates and constraints defined in the Election Manual relate to sections of other governing documents of AMIA. Thus this document is established to collect proposals for review or changes to governing documents of AMIA outside of the Elections Manual with the hope that the AMIA Board and Governance Commmittee takes these into consideration.

## Bylaws. EC Member Count

The Elections Manual states:

> The Committee should consist of three (3) or more Individual Members of AMIA. An odd number of members is recommended.

and the Bylaws state in Article VI ยง2(b)(i)

> The Elections Committee shall consist of two (2) or more members.

It is recommended that the mandate language of both is changes to `shall` and that both reference a minimum of 3 members.

## Bylaws. Election Time Constraints

Several sections of the Bylaws, such as Article III ยง6(m)(i) reference time obligations based upon "the data of the election". The requirements should be clarified to reference either start and/or end of the elections as recent tendency is for long, open elections rather than elections occuring within a single day at a meeting.
